Iterable:- Anything on which you can iterate upon. e.g. tuple, numpy array, list, dictionary, strings, set, files.
           Anything that can be looped over or traversed is Iterable.
           Anything that is Iterable needs to have a special method __iter__().
           We know that double underscore methods are also called dunder methods or special methods  or magic methods.
